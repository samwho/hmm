`hmm` is a small command-line note taking app written in Rust. Notes are
written in plain text and indexed by the time they were written.

`hmm` is inspired by [jrnl][1], though with a slightly different use-case in
mind.

# Comparison to `jrnl`

Features `jrnl` has that `hmm` doesn't:

- Encryption of your notes.
- Ability to add notes at arbitrary points in the past.
- In-built notion of tags.
- In-built notion of starring.
- Ability to edit entries.
- Ability to parse English dates/times, e.g. "yesterday" and "2 weeks ago."

Features `hmm` has that `jrnl` doesn't:

- Unambigous date-format.
- File-format optimised for searching by time.
- Ability to format entries however you want.
- No external dependencies.

If any of the features `jrnl` has that `hmm` is missing are essential to your
workflow, `hmm` isn't for you. That said, I am open to feature requests but
very much plan to keep `hmm` focused on the use-case I designed it for: quick
note taking in the terminal with the ability to search later.

# Installation

No support for Homebrew yet, so Mac users will need to go down the `cargo`
route, but I plan to get it in to the Homebrew repos soon.

## Arch Linux (AUR)

`hmm` is in the AUR, and can be installed with an AUR helper such as `yay`:

    yay -S hmm-bin

## Using cargo

[Install Rust][2], then run:

    cargo install hmmcli

Now the `hmm` and `hmmq` binaries should be available in your terminal.

## From source

[Install Rust][2], [install git][3] then run:

    git clone https://github.com/samwho/hmm
    cd hmm
    cargo install

# Usage

`hmm` is split in to two binaries: `hmm` and `hmmq`. The former is writing
entries, while the latter is for querying them.

## Writing an entry from the CLI

    hmm hello world

This will write an entry to the default `.hmm` file location, which is in
your home directory.

## Writing an entry to a different file

Your `.hmm` file can be located wherever you want, and named whatever you
want.

    hmm --path ~/.notes hello world

## Writing long-form entries in your `EDITOR`

    hmm

Invoked with no arguments, or just a `--path` argument, `hmm` will open your
default `EDITOR` to compose an entry. Saving and quitting that editor will
then write the note to your `.hmm` file. If you don't have an `EDITOR`
configured, you can also pass one as a flag:

    hmm --editor vim

## Listing your entries

    hmmq

By default, this lists all of your entries in a default format in ascending
chronological order. This may not be desired, so there are a bunch of flags
to narrow down what is shown.

### Show the most recent 10 entries

    hmmq --descending -n 10

### Show entries on a specific day

    hmmq --start 2020-01-01 --end 2020-01-02

The `--start` flag is inclusive and the `--end` flag is exclusive, so the
above command will show all entries that were created on the 1st of January
2020.

Dates follow the RFC3339/ISO8601 format, allowing you to omit parts you don't
need. All dates are in your local timezone.

### Show entries on a given year

    hmmq --start 2019 --end 2020

This will show all of your notes from 2019.

### Show entries on a given year in descending order

    hmmq --start 2019 --end 2020 --descending

This will show all of your notes from 2019 but in reverse chronological order.

### Show all entries from a given date

    hmmq --start 2020-02-20

This will print all of your notes from the 20th of February 2020.

### Show a random entry

    hmmq --random

Prints out a random entry. The randomness comes from selecting a random byte
in your `.hmm` file, and as such longer entries are more likely to be picked.
This is a trade-off. Picking entries in a truly random fashion would require
reading the entire file, which is against the philosophy of `hmmq`.

## Formatting entries

`hmmq` makes use of the [Handlebars][4] templating format to determine how entries
are printed to the terminal. Here's an example of a really simple template:

    hmmq --format "{{ datetime }}: {{ message }}"

It's not much to look at, but it shows how the templates look and all of the
variables you have access to inside a template.

`hmmq` offers some helper functions to make your templates look nicer. Here's
the default output format specified explicitly:

    hmmq --format $'{{ color "blue" (strftime "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" datetime) }}\n{{ indent message }}'

The keen reader will notice the `$` before the format argument. This is a bash
quirk. Without it, the `\n` inside the format argument will print literally
instead of being interpreted as a newline.

## Benchmarking

I ran some informal benchmarks on my personal machine. I wasn't looking for the
absolute lowest possible time, but I wanted all operations to feel instant to a
person using the tool.

I generated a `.hmm` file with 20 million entries in it, with times starting at
1970-01-01 spaced 1 minute apart. The file came to ~840M, all entries had the
content `"hello world"`.

### Random entries

    hyperfine 'hmmq --random'

    Benchmark #1: hmmq --random
      Time (mean ± σ):       0.7 ms ±   0.1 ms    [User: 0.7 ms, System: 0.6 ms]
      Range (min … max):     0.5 ms …   1.8 ms    1179 runs

### Entries from a given random start date

    hyperfine 'hmmq --start $(date -d @$(shuf -i 0 -1200000000 -n1) --iso-8601) -n 1'

    Benchmark #1: hmmq --start $(date -d @$(shuf -i 0-1200000000 -n1) --iso-8601) -n 1
      Time (mean ± σ):       3.3 ms ±   0.3 ms    [User: 2.4 ms, System: 1.2 ms]
      Range (min … max):     2.9 ms …   5.9 ms    579 runs

### A large number of entries on a given random start date

    hyperfine 'hmmq --start $(date -d @$(shuf -i 0-1200000000 -n1) --iso-8601) -n 1000'

    Benchmark #1: hmmq --start $(date -d @$(shuf -i 0-1200000000 -n1) --iso-8601) -n 1000
      Time (mean ± σ):      30.9 ms ±   3.0 ms    [User: 29.1 ms, System: 1.8 ms]
      Range (min … max):    28.7 ms …  49.0 ms    98 runs

### A large number of entries from a given end date, descending

    hyperfine 'hmmq --end $(date -d @$(shuf -i 0-1200000000 -n1) --iso-8601) -n 1000 --descending'

    Benchmark #1: hmmq --end $(date -d @$(shuf -i 0-1200000000 -n1) --iso-8601) -n 1000 --descending
      Time (mean ± σ):     120.5 ms ±   6.0 ms    [User: 50.5 ms, System: 69.6 ms]
      Range (min … max):   115.6 ms … 138.0 ms    24 runs

"Why is descending order so much slower than ascending?" you might ask.
At the time of writing, `hmmq` reads all printed entries twice when going
backwards. It does this because it's simple from an implementation
perspective. It would be possible to make this faster if the code were
a bit more complex, but I haven't decided if I want to do that yet.

### Printing the whole file

It ran for a few minutes before I gave up. There's no excellent reason to
want to do this.
